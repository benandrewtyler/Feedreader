# Feed Reader

An asynchronously loaded list of links to popular coding articles.

## Overview

This readme is to give instruction on how to use the Jasmine testing suite built for feedreaders, credit contributers, list useful resources and share future planned developments.
The project started with an initial template provided by Udacity [Udacity git repo](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) 

## Installation/Getting Started

* Clone the project from Github
* Open the index.html file from a code editor
* Check the feeds and test suites

## Built With

* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) - The testing framework used.

## Useful resources

In the following links you will find resources that i utilised whilst building the feedreader tests:
* [W3C's index of HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)
* [W3School's JS tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
* [Udacity git repo](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)
* [MDN's javascript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript)

Any suggestions of additional resources that would be useful to the community
would be warmly welcome and greatly appreciated.
Feel free to add your suggestions by creating a new pull request
with the component "Documentation" with your
comment.

## Acknowledgments

We are particularly grateful to the Udacity community behind the creation of the FEND course, their authors and all their contributors for their great work from which this feed reader tester was greatly inspired and without which perhaps i would not be the front end dev I am today.
Hopefully, new features, patches or tests added to this repo might as well be ported/adapted to be contributed and shared back in return.

## Future developments

I will be adding a link to my Kanban board for future updates to this and other projects, but before this, below is a short list of nice to haves in the short term:

* Updated UI - I would like to add more assets with a non standard art style and make the colour scheme a little more personal
* Winning - Make the act of winning have an incentive, i.e. more winning conditions, scoring, timer that reduces score
* Start page - Add a start menu with character select

Lastly, efforts could be made and hopefully sustained on the overall
maintenance, with improved documentation, tutorials/presentations of how
features could be leveraged or extended and of course the usual bug fixes.
